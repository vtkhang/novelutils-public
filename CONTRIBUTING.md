## What should I know before I get started?

### Scrapy

This project's main platform is Scrapy. You just need to know the core function of Scrapy to start working on this project.

* [How to generate a spider?](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/commands.html#genspider)
* [How to test the crawling process via scrapy shell?](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/shell.html#scrapy-shell)

I didn't use some features of Scrapy as: Item, ItemPipeline, middlewares,... So you're good if you don't want to know about them.

### Epub

Creating epub is a main target of this project, so some knowledge about this format are useful:

- [What's an epub?](https://www.howtogeek.com/362592/what-is-an-epub-file-and-how-do-i-open-one/)
- [Tool to check if an epub have errors or not.](https://github.com/w3c/epubcheck)
